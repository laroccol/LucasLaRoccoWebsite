    <h1>Discord Bot</h1>
    <img src="img/Bot.PNG" alt="" align="right">
    <p>This project was inspired by my discord server because some people who joined the channel liked
    to play songs on their entrance like a walkout song. As a result of that, I thought it was a good idea
    to make a bot that would automatically play a song when a person joined the voice channel. Every person
    would be able to select their own song and it would be saved in a database.
    <br />
    <br />
        I used Discords javascript API discord.js to create the bot and used quick db as my database. Every
    user was able to change their song at anytime by specifying a Youtube Link along with the message specifier.
    The link is then saved in the database where it is then pulled from to play the song when the user joins
    the channel. I continually expand on the features of the bot, recently allowing youtube links with specific
    timestamps to start at. There are also numerous other features of the bot including checking the weather and
    playing small games.</p>

<section class="project-container" id="Esubmit">
    <h1>Esubmit</h1>
    <img src="img/esubmit.png" alt="" align="right">
    <p>Esubmit is the student-created code submittal system tool used by my school in numerous coding classes.
        It is a website that allows students to submit their source code where it will be run and any output will be
        run through tests specified by the instructor. Instructors can then view student submission and leave comments
        on their code.
    I am currently in a year long process of adding to the system and improving upon current features. We
    have a group of four people working on it using the Scrum process.
        <br />
        <br />
        The framework used to build the system is Ruby on Rails which is then run on the school network. The main feature
        I have worked on in this project is a sloppy output feature that allows for leniency in student output. For example,
        if a student didn't capitalize a letter in their output that the professor did, the system will ignore it and only
        treat it as a warning. The purpose of this is to allow students to focus more on the core programming principles
        rather than nit picking at every small detail on assignments where that is not important. We also implemented
        a grading system that allows professors to give students grades through the website itself.

<section class="project-container" id="Game">
    <h1>Multiplayer Game</h1>
    <img src="img/LukeGame.PNG" alt="" align="right">
    <p>I am very interested in games and game development and this is a project that I have spent a lot of time on
    and that I really enjoy. My goal with this project is to create a fun and skillful game that I could play with my
    friends. If I have nothing else to do I will most likely be working on the game constantly adding more and fixing
    issues. Someday I want to release the game so that everybody is able to play it.
    <br />
    <br />
    The game is built using Unreal Engine using a combination of C++ and the blueprint system used in the engine.
    Current the game uses Steam to connect players together using client hosted servers. Dedicated servers are something
    that I have experimented with and got working but the cost to upkeep them is too much money. The main thing I would
    like to get into next with the game is designing my own assets and character models. Right now the game is mostly made
    up of free assets from the marketplace or default engine assets. I am currently learning 3-d modelling and being able
    to import those assets into Unreal.</p>

<section class="project-container" id="Bus">
    <h1>Bus Tracker</h1>
    <img src="img/BusTracker.PNG" alt="" align="right">
    <p>This was a school project I did my Sophomore year that involved taking real-time bus data from MCTS and displaying
    that data on a map along with a table of all the desired data. The system also used a database to store data and times
    when certain buses surpassed a speed threshold.
    <br />
    <br />
    To make this project I used a combination of HTML, Javascript, and React. A mapquest API key was used to use the map where
    the buses would be displayed. Mongo Db wa used to store data about buses going over a certain speed. This project taught
    me the most about creating a website and storing information in a database. </p>
